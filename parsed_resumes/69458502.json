        "troubleshooting of engine problems, both in house and in the field.",
        "Worked on instruction writing, reports, as well as building document revisions.",
        "For example, quality deficiency reports, purchase orders, quality reports, repair orders, engineering reports, capital expenditures, manual",
        "revisions and more.",
        "Developed and optimized tooling, manufacturing, and ground support equipment reviews for open issues or improvements.",
        "Worked on PT6A, T56, and 501 engines mainly in accessory testing and test cell operations.",
        "Designed tooling equipment, electrical circuitry, and hydraulic systems using CATIA V5.",
        "Designed and built testing bench for APU using data acquisition system and measurement devices such as digital readouts, pressure gauges,",
        "and level sensors.",
        "Provided technical support to the Accessory shop department, Engineering department, Machine Shop, Test cell, Management, and the",
        "Operation's department.",
        "Performed receiving and detailed inspection of incoming parts, accessories, and engines to the overhaul facility.",

        "Company Name City Aerospace Engineer 01/2014 to 01/2015",
        "Member of the AIAA and the front line team that developed a novel cooling design system for turbine blades.",
        "Throughout this process, computational fluid dynamic software (STARCCM) and CAD were highly implemented to simulate different",
        "geometries inside a wind tunnel.",
        "Pressures, temperatures, velocities among other important physical quantities were analyzed in 40 different geometries.",
        "This project contributed with the optimization process of turbine blades and aided them to achieve higher temperature levels and efficiency.",
        "It is not a secret in today's industry that turbine engines are able to produce extremely high inlet temperatures when they implement cooling",
        "impingement, which allow them to cool down the system without harming the performance of the engine.",
        "Also, it allows the engine to achieve higher efficiency levels.",
        "Upon this experiment, a research paper was written and patented."
